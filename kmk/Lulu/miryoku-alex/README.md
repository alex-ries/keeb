# Alex's Miryoku
## Intro
This layout is Miryoku inspired with programming in mind as well as gaming, since I like doing both. I got the ideas from a programmer version of Miryoku on Oryx for my Moonlander board, and have done wuite a few tweaks. I like the layout a ton, obviously and I assume I will tweak it more over time. I wanted to publish it here to get folks a starting point and potentially some inspiration. Below are some of the features I figured needed some explaining.
## Symbols left and right
Instead of using the num rows and shifted symbols on one side this uses a left and right hand for dedicated symbols making it much easier to get to the necessary symbols and brackets. Location wise the shifting sits on the second button from center outwards.
## Gamer mode
It really isn't anything more than going back to good old QWERTY for compatibility purposes. The top row gets its numerals back as well since that tends to be needed for many games. There are also some function keys on the right side. Enabling and disabling this layer is a double press on the right hand encoder.I would recommend adjusting this to whatever game you like to play.
## PEG
At this time, due to all the combos used PEG will mess up your config quite a bit. I would recommend manually editing the keymap.
